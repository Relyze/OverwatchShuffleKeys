Overwatch 2 ShuffleKeys POC

This won't work out of the box for everyone, since it doesn't handle every possible shuffle keys permutation correctly from my testing, but I have no use for it anymore, and haven't for nearly a year.
I tested it on the latest Overwatch 2 version as of today, which is 2.10.1.60211, but they'll be moving away from this in the future at some point, so I felt like I may as well share it.

I leave fixing it if your specific shufflekeys doesn't work as an exercise for you.

Below is a general diagram with an analysis of what we have to patch.
